				<p>Every year, FEED GLOBAL HUNGER responds to emergencies and disasters that affect the lives of millions of people around the world.
				Last year, we responded to 41 new and ongoing emergencies, providing humanitarian assistance to more than 7 million people.
				<br>
				<br>
				With emergency-response experts on the ground in over 60 countries — 95% of them citizens of those countries, with local knowledge and expertise — we provide emergency food, relief supplies, water, sanitation, shelter, health care and livelihoods support to people in need.
				<br>
				<p>
				After people’s immediate needs are met, we stay on to support affected people and communities to rebuild their lives and livelihoods.
				And we advocate for changes and improvements to the way the world responds to emergencies.</p>
				<p>That’s why we help communities to plan for emergencies and reduce the risks of harmful impacts from future disasters – such as by advising on how to build safer housing, or supporting farmers to grow drought-resistant crops.
